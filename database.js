We can pull the scrollbar information directly from the map to generate it on-the-fly. Then, when someone
ticks to a new year, we'll go through the sections and look for which section it belongs to, scrolling
automatically to it (if needed) and updating the map. I'm using a start/end system for the sections so
sections that cover a wide range (i.e. 1920 - 1950, the WWI/II years) can be on the same narrative, while
still allowing the user to go through the years. If title is blank, we wouldn't push one, creating seemless
content.

When President Thomas Jefferson purchased this land from the French in 1803, he sent for Meriwether Lewis to form an expedition to survey the recently purchased land, create diplomatic relations with the Native American tribes that they met, extend the fur trade network and find the Northwest Passage to the Pacific (Buckley 2014).  With the help of William Clark they put together a small team of soldiers and set sail along the Missouri River in 1804.  Along their journey they eventually came into contact with the Mandan and Hidatsa tribes near present-day Bismarck, North Dakota and hired the help of two interprets, French-Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his Shoshone wife Sakakawea, who helped the Lewis and Clark expedition immensely in navigating through a landscape that was completely new to them and helping establish relations with the local tribes they came into contact with (Buckley 2014).  The expedition came to an end in 1806 and has been considered one of the greatest American exploration endeavors in history. Clark’s maps were published in 1810 and were popularly used for over thirty years by future settlers and adventures looking for a new life in the West.'

Custer led the 7th Cavalry from Fort Abraham Lincoln, in present-day Mandan, North Dakota, to fight off the Sioux, Arapaho, and Cheyenne tribes in Montana at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Custer and the entire 7th Calvary were annihilated in the battle and it is still considered one of the greatest victories of the time (Waldman 191). The Sioux wars ended in 1890 with the Battle of Wounded Knee in South Dakota. There were a great many American Indian causalities, which led to the end of the wars (Waldman 196). '

In 1880 Military reserves were also opened for homestead in the eastern and central portion of the northern Dakota.

One of the many things to come out of this period was the reemergence of the Sons of Norway lodges such as the Hjemkomst Center in Fargo-Moorhead and the Sons of Norway lodge in Grand Forks. Gyde Vorden Lodge was the first Sons of Norway lodge to be founded in North Dakota in 1903. Many of these lodges were popular with Norwegian Americans for multiple years, however by the end of World War I the number of members began to dwindle. But in recent years membership has begun to increase. The Hostfest in Minot has also been a popular Norwegian cultural event that promotes much of the early immigrant’s culture and way of life through festival activities and music, such as performances by choral societies and fiddling.

The band chiefs and clan leaders of these tribes met annually with other members of the Seven Council Fires to socialize and discuss matters of importance. The name “Sioux” is believed to have derived from the Chippewa word Nadouessioux, meaning “adders” or “lesser enemy.” (Waldman 2009:191).

In the Medicine Dance, people are initiated into the ability to cure and to the sacred mysteries of the medicine men (Schneider 1994:82).  The version of the Sun Dance practiced by the Dakota is much more informal than what is practiced by the Lakota.  This would be due to the fact that many Dakota did not generally believe in self-sacrificing.  If they did practice the self-sacrificing aspect, enduring the pain of the Sun Dance prepared them for the pain of life that would come as a medicine man or warrior (Schneider 1994:82).          '

Drought ravaged the state greatly affecting the total number of bushels produced. “The wheat crop was poor in 1916, 1917, and 1919” averaging only 50,000,000 to 60,000,000 bushels of wheat in total production.  1917 was the driest year that North Dakota had seen since statehood. It would only be passed in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl which historians and climatologist call the greatest ecological disaster of the twentieth century. However, not all the years yielded poor crops. For instance in 1914 and 1919 the state produced an average wheat crop of around 100,000,000 bushels. Only in 1915 did the state’s full agricultural might truly show. During that season a record breaking 159,000,000 bushels were grown. '

Then, 1979 oil boomed again, and the price had shot to a little over $70 per barrel.  These booms of course coincide with the oil embargos put in place by President Nixon, and the first Iraq/Iran occupations by the United States. '

Unlike oil however, this industry was much more limited. Below surface mining was regulated in all facets by the “Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969” which protected the workers of mines at the cost of the operators. North Dakota was uniquely poised to offer a solution to the coal industry however as it had a large amount of lignite coal, which is found much closer to the surface and can be accessed via strip mining. Since lignite is considered the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to coal due to its low heat yield it had been more or less ignored until now. Following this, the Nixon administration created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 which would come to reduce the long term feasibility of strip mining in North Dakota, but it did create a short term window of opportunity in North Dakota that helps account for the states growth and subsequent shrinking in the 1980s and 1990s.'

Regulation on the disposal of the brine has changed since the start of the boom due to environmental concerns. It is also a very political topic with strong opinions on both sides.

Although there are only two active Synagogues, there are other ones that meet occasionally for special events such as a wedding, Bar or Bat Mitzvahs, or Brit Milahs. The Association of Religious Data Archives show that in 2010 there were 176 adherents to the faith but it is very likely that this number could actually be much larger because these numbers were retrieved from the individual synagogues and did not take into account Jews who are still very devout in their faith, but are living in other areas that do not have to the services of a Rabbi. Furthermore this number seems much too small as the number of adherents in 2000 was at a staggering 730. In 1990 it was 493, and in 1980 it was at 269. This pattern shows a gradual increase and then a sharp decline in 2010. Historically, we have found little that would account for such a drastic change in numbers. Therefore, as one can see on correlating map, there are only dots within Grand Forks and Cass counties because Jewish people are really only prevalent in the cities of Grand Forks and Fargo because these are the only two cities with synagogues in them.'

With that information we can estimate the total population of Hutterites in the state at somewhere around 700 adherents, perhaps a little lower. Because the Hutterites are a communal society, they all live on the colony grounds, therefore all Hutterites will be found on one of the seven colonies in the state. Since the Hutterites do not proselytize, generally the only way for the for their number to increase is by being born into the system, which is one reason why most colonies only have three or four last names {{cite:6}}. Likewise the most common way for the the numbers to decrease is by death and by people (generally young men) choosing to leave the community not to return.

The effort stalled initially, but after he had successfully bankrolled the Union victory in the Civil War, a Philadelphia financier named Jay Cooke undertook to build the Northern Pacific Railroad.  In all, the NP received more than 45 million acres of land -- a territory the size of North Dakota.

His approach to railroad building was quite different than Jay Cooke\'s. His line, the Great Northern, didn\'t have a land grant. It also didn\'t have a deadline for reaching the West Coast. Rather than earn a subsidy, Hill had to build a market. To accomplish this, he undertook an aggressive program of branch lines. These soon spread across the northern half of the state, and Hill\'s railroad brought immigrant farmers from across the globe. Unlike Cooke and the NP, he didn\'t care where the new farmers came from. He cared that they grew crops that he could take to markets in the Minneapolis. The growers\' success mattered to Hill, and he sent farm agents along his line and its branches to introduce the latest agricultural practices. Sometimes Hill himself undertook these trips. He also practiced what he preached. Hill started a large farm in the Red River Valley, on Minnesota\'s side of the river.'

Cooke himself had long since lost control of the NP, but his successors -- men whose names are scattered across the maps of the Northern Plains -- soon realized that Hill\'s business model was better than their own. By the 1890s, the NP had begun building branch lines in the Red River Valley, and in two decades -- up to 1915 -- its network rivaled -- though it never surpassed -- Hill\'s own.'

Its tracks cut diagonally across the southwestern corner of the state and were never more than 30 miles from its southern border. The service was vital to the towns along the line, of course, but the Milwaukee never achieved the dominance of other transcontinental roads. It did help to establish such small cities as Hettinger and Bowman, which have outlived the line. Marmarth, its divisional headquarters, contracted sharply when the Milwaukee shut down.  Once a bustling town of hotels, shops and theaters, Marmarth today is an eclectic collection of antiques -- human and material -- and memories. The Milwaukee\'s dormitory operates as an overnight guest house. The Milwaukee depot has been moved from its historic location and sits, sagging and rather forlorn, at the east end of town.'

Pembina and Adams counties were the first to be hit in 1931.{{cite:14}} The grasshopper plague continued to spiral out of control. What little the farmers could grow was devoured by swarms of insects. In Killdeer grasshoppers piled up four inches deep, blanketing the town.{{cite:15}} In another instance the town of Mott had to turn on their street lamps in the middle of the day because the swarm of grasshoppers had blotted out the sun. This shadow was cast all over the state.'

The Great Depression caused havoc across the US but drought, plague, and weather combined to make North Dakota particularly unbearable. Spirits were low, the weather the worse and many saw no way out. Yet a light was at the end of the tunnel. With another World War soon on the way North Dakota would reclaim its rightful place as wheat providers to the United States. '
