We can pull the scrollbar information directly from the map to generate it on-the-fly. Then, when someone
ticks to a new year, we'll go through the sections and look for which section it belongs to, scrolling
automatically to it (if needed) and updating the map. I'm using a start/end system for the sections so
sections that cover a wide range (i.e. 1920 - 1950, the WWI/II years) can be on the same narrative, while
still allowing the user to go through the years. If title is blank, we wouldn't push one, creating seemless
content.

The heat and dust storms also wreaked havoc on the cattle ranches in the western end of the state. Ranchers struggled to keep their herds hydrated and fed. Many cattle simply dropped dead from inhalation of dust, suffocating from the very air around them. If your herd made it through the summer months to the winter a whole new set of challenges arose. Food became more and more difficult to find. With the growing season decimated the state wasn\'t able to save enough food to feed themselves let alone herds of livestock. Many ranchers sold their herds off only retaining their prized breeding stock feeding them whatever they could find.'

Pembina and Adams counties were the first to be hit in 1931.{{cite:14}} The grasshopper plague continued to spiral out of control. What little the farmers could grow was devoured by swarms of insects. In Killdeer grasshoppers piled up four inches deep, blanketing the town.{{cite:15}} In another instance the town of Mott had to turn on their street lamps in the middle of the day because the swarm of grasshoppers had blotted out the sun. This shadow was cast all over the state.'

The Great Depression caused havoc across the US but drought, plague, and weather combined to make North Dakota particularly unbearable. Spirits were low, the weather the worse and many saw no way out. Yet a light was at the end of the tunnel. With another World War soon on the way North Dakota would reclaim its rightful place as wheat providers to the United States. '
