We can pull the scrollbar information directly from the map to generate it on-the-fly. Then, when someone
ticks to a new year, we'll go through the sections and look for which section it belongs to, scrolling
automatically to it (if needed) and updating the map. I'm using a start/end system for the sections so
sections that cover a wide range (i.e. 1920 - 1950, the WWI/II years) can be on the same narrative, while
still allowing the user to go through the years. If title is blank, we wouldn't push one, creating seemless
content.

When President Thomas Jefferson purchased this land from the French in 1803, he sent for Meriwether Lewis to form an expedition to survey the recently purchased land, create diplomatic relations with the Native American tribes that they met, extend the fur trade network and find the Northwest Passage to the Pacific (Buckley 2014).  With the help of William Clark they put together a small team of soldiers and set sail along the Missouri River in 1804.  Along their journey they eventually came into contact with the Mandan and Hidatsa tribes near present-day Bismarck, North Dakota and hired the help of two interprets, French-Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his Shoshone wife Sakakawea, who helped the Lewis and Clark expedition immensely in navigating through a landscape that was completely new to them and helping establish relations with the local tribes they came into contact with (Buckley 2014).  The expedition came to an end in 1806 and has been considered one of the greatest American exploration endeavors in history. Clark’s maps were published in 1810 and were popularly used for over thirty years by future settlers and adventures looking for a new life in the West.'

Custer led the 7th Cavalry from Fort Abraham Lincoln, in present-day Mandan, North Dakota, to fight off the Sioux, Arapaho, and Cheyenne tribes in Montana at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Custer and the entire 7th Calvary were annihilated in the battle and it is still considered one of the greatest victories of the time (Waldman 191). The Sioux wars ended in 1890 with the Battle of Wounded Knee in South Dakota. There were a great many American Indian causalities, which led to the end of the wars (Waldman 196). '

In 1880 Military reserves were also opened for homestead in the eastern and central portion of the northern Dakota.

One of the many things to come out of this period was the reemergence of the Sons of Norway lodges such as the Hjemkomst Center in Fargo-Moorhead and the Sons of Norway lodge in Grand Forks. Gyde Vorden Lodge was the first Sons of Norway lodge to be founded in North Dakota in 1903. Many of these lodges were popular with Norwegian Americans for multiple years, however by the end of World War I the number of members began to dwindle. But in recent years membership has begun to increase. The Hostfest in Minot has also been a popular Norwegian cultural event that promotes much of the early immigrant’s culture and way of life through festival activities and music, such as performances by choral societies and fiddling.

The band chiefs and clan leaders of these tribes met annually with other members of the Seven Council Fires to socialize and discuss matters of importance. The name “Sioux” is believed to have derived from the Chippewa word Nadouessioux, meaning “adders” or “lesser enemy.” (Waldman 2009:191).

In the Medicine Dance, people are initiated into the ability to cure and to the sacred mysteries of the medicine men (Schneider 1994:82).  The version of the Sun Dance practiced by the Dakota is much more informal than what is practiced by the Lakota.  This would be due to the fact that many Dakota did not generally believe in self-sacrificing.  If they did practice the self-sacrificing aspect, enduring the pain of the Sun Dance prepared them for the pain of life that would come as a medicine man or warrior (Schneider 1994:82).          '

In 1916 a grand total of 12,200,000 acres were under cultivation for wheat. By 1917 that number had risen to 14,085,000 acres and by 1919 there were 15,417,000 acres being cultivated in the state. Yet the total yield of the crops varied from year to year simply because of North Dakota’s climate. Drought ravaged the state greatly affecting the total number of bushels produced. “The wheat crop was poor in 1916, 1917, and 1919” averaging only 50,000,000 to 60,000,000 bushels of wheat in total production.  1917 was the driest year that North Dakota had seen since statehood. It would only be passed in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl which historians and climatologist call the greatest ecological disaster of the twentieth century. However, not all the years yielded poor crops. For instance in 1914 and 1919 the state produced an average wheat crop of around 100,000,000 bushels. Only in 1915 did the state’s full agricultural might truly show. During that season a record breaking 159,000,000 bushels were grown. '

The energy interest nation wide had seen a huge increase in the price for oil, making drilling in North Dakota far more cost effective. Starting in 1973 prices rose from about $15 per barrel to $45 in 1974. Prices then began to fall steadily from 1974 and bottoming out in 1977 at around $35 per barrel. Then, 1979 oil boomed again, and the price had shot to a little over $70 per barrel.  These booms of course coincide with the oil embargos put in place by President Nixon, and the first Iraq/Iran occupations by the United States. '

Unlike oil however, this industry was much more limited. Below surface mining was regulated in all facets by the “Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969” which protected the workers of mines at the cost of the operators. North Dakota was uniquely poised to offer a solution to the coal industry however as it had a large amount of lignite coal, which is found much closer to the surface and can be accessed via strip mining. Since lignite is considered the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to coal due to its low heat yield it had been more or less ignored until now. Following this, the Nixon administration created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 which would come to reduce the long term feasibility of strip mining in North Dakota, but it did create a short term window of opportunity in North Dakota that helps account for the states growth and subsequent shrinking in the 1980s and 1990s.'

It involves sending a mixture of water and other chemicals through the ground to push fuel and natural gas from the shale to the surface. The crude oil is collected, as is a portion of the natural gas, leaving some of the gas to be “flared” off the top of the rig. Regulation on the disposal of the brine has changed since the start of the boom due to environmental concerns. It is also a very political topic with strong opinions on both sides.

The large amounts of wheat produced were sent down to Minneapolis which increased their growth.
