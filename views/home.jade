                        p
                            |The project is led by Dr. Michael Niedzielski (Geography) and by Dr. Tami Carmichael (Integrated Studies) with support from Dr. Debbie Storrs, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and  Michael Jacobs, former publisher of the Grand Forks Herald.
                        h3 Purpose
                        p
                            |The purpose of the atlas is to engage an interdisciplinary group of students in experiential and collaborative learning to map demographic, economic, and social changes across the state, interpreting such changes, and disseminating findings in a digital format. The atlas will provide several benefits:
                            ul
                                li It will be an important resource for policy makers, community members, and K-12 colleagues and students.
                                li It will expand students' educational experiences through experiential and collaborative learning with significant community engagement and impact.
                                li It will provide a tangible product for public consumption to increase participation of the public as informed citizens.

                            |In the first year of this project during Fall 2014, four groups were formed combining students from Dr. Niedzielski's GEOG471 Cartography & Visualization course and students from six participating departments under A&S499 Interdisciplinary Practicum. During the first year of the project (2014-2015), there are four groups, each with 2 students from A&S499 and 2-4 students from GEOG471. Each group is responsible for telling the story of a chosen theme through maps, graphs and narratives. Two other groups are working on the technical and artistic design of the interactive atlas. Specifically, the four themes are:

                            |We are studying North Dakota's population over time. We are gathering census data from statehood to the present. Maps that show population by county will be created for each census. When viewed together the maps will show the evolution of the state as its population pushed westward and concentrates into cities. Our narratives will focus on explaining the reasons behind major fluxes in North Dakota's population.

                            |We're challenged with creating the interactive, online application for the North Dakota Atlas project. Our primary goals are: (1) to create a clean, intuitive interface for the students gathering the information, maps, and narratives to easily create and maintain the atlas without needing further technical assistance; and (2) allow for the creation of interactive maps from digital data on-the-fly, allowing for the dynamic creation for maps from available data for integration with narratives.
                            |Our biggest challenges will be developing a user interface that is consistent for multiple devices and screen sizes, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops and integrating existing technologies and algorithms to allow for the dynamic elements of the atlas.
                            |By creating a content management system, our application can be extended to further projects and allow other schools or organizations to create their own online atlas. We look forward to helping honor North Dakota's 125th anniversary and helping with a project that has great educational and informational potential.
