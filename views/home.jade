                        p
                            |The idea of this multidisciplinary project was conceived by Dr. Michael Niedzielski who also leads the project  with support from Dr. Debbie Storrs, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and Michael Jacobs, former publisher of the Grand Forks Herald. During 2014-2015, support was also provided by Dr. Tami Carmichael (Integrated Studies), while during 2015-2016  support was provided by Dr. Bradley Rundquist (Administrative Fellow in the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Geography).

The atlas will provide several benefits:
                            ul
                                li It will be an important resource for policy makers, community members, and K-12 colleagues and students.
                                li It will expand students' educational experiences through experiential and collaborative learning with significant community engagement and impact.
                                li It will provide a tangible product for public consumption to increase participation of the public as informed citizens.

Each group is responsible for telling the story of a chosen theme through maps, graphs and narratives. The project is also supported by a group of students taking Dr. Desell’s Capstone course in Computer Science who work on the technical design of the interactive atlas.

Our primary goals are: (1) to create a clean, intuitive interface for the students gathering the information, maps, and narratives to easily create and maintain the atlas without needing further technical assistance; and (2) allow for the creation of interactive maps from digital data on-the-fly, allowing for the dynamic creation for maps from available data for integration with narratives.
                            |Our biggest challenges will be developing a user interface that is consistent for multiple devices and screen sizes, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops and integrating existing technologies and algorithms to allow for the dynamic elements of the atlas.
                            |By creating a content management system, our application can be extended to further projects and allow other schools or organizations to create their own online atlas.
